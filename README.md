This project is an HTML website which will showcase a few different recipes.

After completing this project, a few of the basic HTML skills which I will demonstrate include being able to utilize links, images, and lists.

Jasmine Pak at the tasty team is the original creator of the majority of the content on the boba.html webpage
Emily Nabors Hall is the original creator of the majority of the content on the cheesburger.html page
