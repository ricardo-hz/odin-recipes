        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            I originally found this cookie from crumbl cookies and I fell in love when I had my first bite. I live in Silver
            Spring, MD (a suburb of Washington, DC) and when I took the train through DC and into Falls Church, VA, another DC suburb.
            The train ride ride was about an hour and a half, but it was more than worth it. I fell in love as soon as I ate this cookie.
            Sadly, I only bought two :( I can't wait for crumbl to bring this cookie back, but in the mean time hopefully this recipe will do.

            The key lime pie cookie is originally a pie-inspired cookie released by a company named Crumbl Cookies which releases a variety
            of flavors every week for people to try. The cookie has a slight zest flavor given to it by the lime, while also being supported by a graham cracker
            base, a semi-sour filling, and whipped cream.

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <h3>Graham Cracker Cookies</h3>
            <li>Preheat oven to 350Â°F. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper or a baking mat, set aside.</li>
            <li>In the bowl of a stand mixer, cream the butter, brown sugar, and granulated sugar, about 2-3 minutes. </li>
            <li>Add eggs, vanilla extract, and light corn syrup and mix to combine.</li>
            <li>Add flour, graham cracker crumbs, cornstarch, baking soda, baking powder, and salt and mix until combined. </li>
            <li>Use a 1/4 cup to portion the dough into round balls. Place 6 balls of dough on a baking sheet.</li>
            <li>Bake for 11-13 minutes or until edges are slightly golden and tops are just set. </li>
            <li>Spray the bottom of a glass cup with nonstick cooking spray. The cup should be smaller than the cookie.
                Remove the cookies from the oven and immediately use the bottom of the glass cup to press down in the center of each cookie to create an indentation.</li>
            <li>Let cookies stay on baking sheet for 10 minutes before transferring to a wire rack to cool completely. Make lime filling while cookies cool. </li>
        </ol>
        <ol>
            <h3>Key Lime Filling</h3>
            <li>In a medium bowl beat cream cheese until very smooth. Add sweetened condensed milk, lime juice, and lime zest and mix until very smooth. </li>
        </ol>
        <ol>
            <h3>Assembly</h3>
            <li>Spoon 1-2 tbsps of lime filling on top of each cookie. Top with a lime wedge and dollop of whipped topping, if desired. 
                Cover the cookies and place in the fridge to chill before serving.</li>
        </ol>
