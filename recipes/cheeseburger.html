        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>The cheeseburger, an American classic. While this sandwich may seem basic, the number of flavors that you
             are able to achieve when cooking a cheeseburger is unmatched when compared to other foods. Ultimately, a
             cheeseburger is nothing more but a piece of meat with bread and cheese, but when talking about flavor, 
             it's so much more.
        </p>
        <p>The recipe I will be sharing with you today is for a burger called the "Hatch Chile Smash Burger." This burger
            looks incredible and I will be making it myself soon :)

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Using your hands, combine beef, onion, chiles, salt, and black pepper in a large bowl just until 
                evenly incorporated. Shape into 8 (2 1/2-ounce) balls. </li>
            <li>Heat a large cast-iron skillet or griddle over high until smoking. Add 2 tablespoons oil.</li>
            <li>Add 4 meatballs, and immediately flatten to 1/4-inch-thickness with a sturdy, wide spatula. 
                Cook until bottoms are crisp and deep brown, about 1 minute.</li>
            <li>Flip patties, top each with 1 cheese slice, and cook until bottoms are well charred and cheese 
                is melted, 45 seconds to 1 minute.</li>
            <li>Remove from skillet, and cover to keep warm. Repeat with remaining 2 tablespoons oil, 
                remaining 4 meatballs, and remaining 4 cheese slices. </li>
            <li>Preheat broiler to high with oven rack 5 to 6 inches from heat.</li>
            <li>Brush cut sides of buns with butter. Arrange buns, cut side up, on a baking sheet. </li>
            <li>Broil in preheated oven until toasted, 1 to 2 minutes.</li>
            <li>Spread each bottom bun half with 1 1/2 tablespoons mayonnaise, top with 2 patties, 
                and spoon 1 1/2 tablespoons Hatch chile salsa over top.</li>
            <li>Cover with top bun halves, serve immediately</li>
        </ol>
